Matplotlib is a plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is highly customizable and widely used for generating plots and charts.

Data Cleaning Data cleaning refers to the process of identifying and correcting (or removing) errors and inconsistencies in the data to improve its quality. This step is crucial because poor-quality data can lead to inaccurate analysis and misleading results.

Data Preprocessing Data preprocessing involves transforming raw data into a format that is suitable for analysis or modeling. This step often follows data cleaning and prepares the data for machine learning algorithms.
