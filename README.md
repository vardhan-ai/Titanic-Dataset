Pandas Purpose: Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures like Series (1-dimensional) and DataFrame (2-dimensional) that make it easy to work with structured data.

NumPy Purpose: NumPy (Numerical Python) is a library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and a wide range of mathematical functions to operate on these data structures.

Seaborn Purpose: Seaborn is a statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

Matplotlib Purpose: Matplotlib is a plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is highly customizable and widely used for generating plots and charts.
Data Cleaning Data cleaning refers to the process of identifying and correcting (or removing) errors and inconsistencies in the data to improve its quality. This step is crucial because poor-quality data can lead to inaccurate analysis and misleading results.

Data Preprocessing Data preprocessing involves transforming raw data into a format that is suitable for analysis or modeling. This step often follows data cleaning and prepares the data for machine learning algorithms.
